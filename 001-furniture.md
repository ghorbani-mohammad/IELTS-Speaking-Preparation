#### 1. Do you have a lof of furniture in your home?
"I have **quite a bit** actually." I've got **a big sofa** in my living room in front of the TV, there's also a **smallish dining table** with few small chairs around the it. I've also got a big **bookcase** full of books, DVDs, board games, pictures - all kinds of stuff. Finally, in my bedroom there's a fairly large **wardrobe** for all my clothes. So I'd say there's a **decent amount** of furniture in my home."
