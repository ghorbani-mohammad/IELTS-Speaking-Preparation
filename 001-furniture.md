#### 1. Do you have a lof of furniture in your home?
"I have **quite a bit** actually." I've got **a big sofa** in my living room in front of the TV, there's also a **smallish dining table** with few small chairs around the it. I've also got a big **bookcase** full of books, DVDs, board games, pictures - all kinds of stuff. Finally, in my bedroom there's a fairly large **wardrobe** for all my clothes. So I'd say there's a **decent amount** of furniture in my home."

#### 2. Is there anyone who has bought furniture for you?
"**As far as I can remember**, the last time anyone bought me a **item of furniture** was when my family **moved into** a new house and bought me a new desk for my bedroom. While I was growing up too, when I **outgrew** my old beds they would buy me a new one, but that's all I can remember **off the top of my head**."

#### 3. What kind of furniture would you like to buy?
"**Ideally**, I'd like to get a nice and professional **swivel chair**, because sitting in my current one for too long make my back hurt. It didn't cost very much when I bought my current one, so I would like to **splurge** on something **top-of-the-line** that I would enjoy sitting in for **extended periods of time**."
