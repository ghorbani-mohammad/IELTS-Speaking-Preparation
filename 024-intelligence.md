#### 1. Why are some children more intelligent than others?
To be honest, I don't think there's only one **definition** of intelligence. I think there are many different types of it, so some children **excel** at school because they have a high level of **academic intelligence** or a very **strong memory**. Whereas other kids who feel 'stupid' just have a different type of intelligence. Maybe they are **socially intelligent** or **physically** with their body. So I think children find their talent at different times and I don't think any one child is smarter than the other because they all have different skills.
