#### 1. What topics do young people talk about?
I suppose like most young people around the world, they like to **chat** about all the latest trends, such as music, video games, or celebrities. Most young people tend to be followers, of the same influencers on social media, so they can all react and gossip about their latest posts and events at the same time. As well as that, they might talk about their school life, because school plays a large role in their daily lives. So I think those are some things they like to talk about.
