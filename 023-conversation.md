#### 1. What topics do young people talk about?
I suppose like most young people around the world, they like to **chat** about all the latest trends, such as music, video games, or celebrities. Most young people tend to be **followers**, of the same **influencers** on social media, so they can all react and **gossip** about their latest posts and events at the same time. As well as that, they might talk about their school life, because school **plays a large role** in their daily lives. So I think those are some things they like to talk about.

#### 2. What's the difference between the topics popular now and those in the past?
To be honest, I don't think there's much difference between the topics that people discussed in the past **versus** nowadays. Perhaps the newest things is news surrounding **internet celebrities** or **social media influencers**, who obviously **weren't around** a few decades ago. However, things like news, politics, music, TV shows, and movies are all still very **frequently-discussed** topics. So I don't think that much has changed.

#### 3. How do you know if others are not interested in your conversation?
Their **body language** is usually the main **giveaway**. Lack of **eye contact** is another **tell-tale sign** that someone isn't **engaged** or interested in what you have to say. So if they are looking at the floor or their eyes are **wandering** around the room, then you might want to change the subject. **Crossed arms** are also a sign that someone doesn't feel completely comfortable in the conversation. Of course, the biggest **dead giveaway** is if someone's playing on their phone instead of listening to you.

#### 4. What's the influence of modern technology, such as the internet and e-mails, on our communication?
The **speed of communication** has increased **dramatically** since **the advent of the internet**. We can **ping** messages to the other side of **the globe** with **touch of a button**, which is incredible and make it easier to **keep up** with friends who live far away. At the same time however, because communication is **border-line instant**, then it comes with added pressure of completing tasks faster for work. The fact that you're always 'online' or **reachable** on your phone or **via** email can create a lot of stress. So I think those are some main influences on people now.
