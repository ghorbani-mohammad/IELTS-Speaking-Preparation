#### 1. What topics do young people talk about?
I suppose like most young people around the world, they like to **chat** about all the latest trends, such as music, video games, or celebrities. Most young people tend to be **followers**, of the same **influencers** on social media, so they can all react and **gossip** about their latest posts and events at the same time. As well as that, they might talk about their school life, because school **plays a large role** in their daily lives. So I think those are some things they like to talk about.

#### 2. What's the difference between the topics popular now and those in the past?
To be honest, I don't think there's much difference between the topics that people discussed in the past **versus** nowadays. Perhaps the newest things is news surrounding **internet celebrities** or **social media influencers**, who obviously **weren't around** a few decades ago. However, things like news, politics, music, TV shows, and movies are all still very **frequently-discussed** topics. So I don't think that much has changed.
