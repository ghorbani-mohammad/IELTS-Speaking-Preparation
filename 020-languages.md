#### 1. At what age should children start learning a foreign language?
I think they should start learning as soon as possible. **Ideally** around 4 or 5 years old, because at that age, kids' brains are able to **absorb** huge amounts of information very quickly. They're also still learning about their **mother tongue**, so their brain **readily accepts** and **stores** a lot of new grammar, vocabulary and structures, which helps kids learn languages much quicker than teens or adults can. So I think **the sooner the better**, as it only gets more challenging **later in life**.

#### 2. Which skill is more important, speaking or writing?
I suppose it depends on what you need the language for. If you're already living and working in a country, then speaking is probably the most important thing, because you need to **deal with** customers and colleagues **face-to-face**, and the only writing you do will be **composing** short emails. However, if you're a student practising for an exam, then you'll probably **be tasked with** writing essays or **grammatically correct** sentences, so then **written ability** will be much more important.
