#### 1. At what age should children start learning a foreign language?
I think they should start learning as soon as possible. **Ideally** around 4 or 5 years old, because at that age, kids' brains are able to **absorb** huge amounts of information very quickly. They're also still learning about their **mother tongue**, so their brain **readily accepts** and **stores** a lot of new grammar, vocabulary and structures, which helps kids learn languages much quicker than teens or adults can. So I think **the sooner the better**, as it only gets more challenging **later in life**.
