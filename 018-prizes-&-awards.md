#### 1. What kinds of prizes do students get?
In schools, most students are awarded **relatively small** prizes, like candy, **ribbons**, medals, certificates or even small **trophies** they can show to their friends and family. I suppose schools don't have much **financing** to **shell out** on really **elaborate** or expensive prizes, so I think they **stick to** simple ones.

#### 2. Should students get the same prize in sports and academics?
Yes, I think that would be fair. At the moment, it seems like athletes and **sporty** students get the more **spectacular** and impressive prizes, like medals and trophies, **whereas** academic students rarely receive anything quite so **extravagant**. So I think they should be rewarded **equally** and **recognized** for their achievements in the same way.

#### 3. Why should people be awarded?
Award and prizes are great **motivational tools** for kids and for adults as well. Once people know there's a prize **on the line**, they give an extra 10%, **dig deep** and really **try their best**, which I think is a great way for people to realize their true **potential** and improve their skills. If there were no prizes, they wouldn't **put in half the effort**.

#### 4. Are awards always good for the winners?
**To an extent yes**, because winning awards and prizes can give people confidence in their own abilities. However, too many rewards and prizes can make people **cocky** and **big-headed** because they think they are better than everyone else. **Conversely**, it could even stop people from reaching their potential because they already think they are the best in the school or office, so they stop **giving it their all** and actually **fall behind** their peers.
