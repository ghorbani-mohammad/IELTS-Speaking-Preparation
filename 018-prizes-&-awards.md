#### 1. What kinds of prizes do students get?
In schools, most students are awarded **relatively small** prizes, like candy, **ribbons**, medals, certificates or even small **trophies** they can show to their friends and family. I suppose schools don't have much **financing** to **shell out** on really **elaborate** or expensive prizes, so I think they **stick to** simple ones.

#### 2. Should students get the same prize in sports and academics?
Yes, I think that would be fair. At the moment, it seems like athletes and **sporty** students get the more **spectacular** and impressive prizes, like medals and trophies, **whereas** academic students rarely receive anything quite so **extravagant**. So I think they should be rewarded **equally** and **recognized** for their achievements in the same way.
