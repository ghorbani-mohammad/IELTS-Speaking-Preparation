#### 1. What bad behavior do children usually do?
"Children tend to **act out** by being very load, which is often **disruptive** for their parents and their teachers. As well as that, sometimes children **disrespect** public spaces by littering or leaving their empty food wrappers on the ground behind them. As kids become teens, they might start **swearing** to **look cool** in front of their friends because they think it's **rebellious** and makes them seem **fearless**."

#### 2. How should parents stop their children from behaving badly in public?
"I think parents first need to **instill** some good behaviors into their children, as in, they need to remind them to have respect for other people's personal space and **social etiquette**. By setting rules and **disciplining** them for breaking them, their kids will eventually learn **right from wrong**. That way, even if they are **unsupervised**, the children will remember to follow rules and behave well."

#### 3. Are parents these days stricter than those in the past? I don't think so.
"In the past, parents used to **smack** their children or use **corporal punishment** to discipline their kids, whereas nowadays, modern parents rarely **lay a finger** on their children. As well as that, parents only rewarded their children on special occasions like birthdays or graduations, but nowadays it feels like parents **shower** their children in gifts, like iPads, games consoles and toys. So I think parents are much more **lenient** these days."

#### 4. Whose influence on children is more important, friends' or parents?
"I suppose the parents' influence should be **considered** more important to a child. The parents always want **what's best** for their child, which means they try and **steer** them **in the right direction** by giving them advice about their education or career choices so they can be happy and successful in the future. Friends, on the other hand, only tend to think **in the short term**, and encourage their friends to study less and play more, so overall I'd say parents' influence should take **precedence** over anyone else."
