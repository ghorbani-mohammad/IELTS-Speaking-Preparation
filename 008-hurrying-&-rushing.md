#### 1. What do you always do in a hurry? Why?
I always end up **scoffing down** my breakfast every weekday morning - probably because I always **hit snooze** on my phone so I can sleep in a little longer. I can eat a bowl of cereal or some fruit in **just under 5 minutes** before I head out the door - I'm getting quite good at it now.

#### 2. What kind of things would you never do in a hurry?
I never like to **rush** shaving because my razor blades are pretty sharp. So if I'm not **careful**, I usually end up **nicking** myself with the blade, which hurts and takes time to clean up as well. I also **take my time** when I'm cooking for much the same reasons, because I'm always **afraid of** cutting myself while chopping vegetables, so I do it **nice and slowly**.

#### 3. Do you usually go out in a hurry?
I try to **give myself enough time** to **get ready regardless of whether** I'm going to work or going out to see my friends. If it's **the latter** then I'll **try on** one or two different outfits, and I'll also **double check** to **make sure** I bring everything with me like my phone, my wallet or my keys.

#### 4. Do you like to be in a hurry?
No I don't. Being **pressed for time** makes me quite **anxious** normally, and my boss at work is also quite strict and **reprimands** me for being even 10 minutes late. If I'm **running late** then I get stressed, **which in turn** makes me forget things too, so overall I try to give myself **plenty of time** to do things.
