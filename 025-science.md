#### 1. What's the best invention in the past one hundred years?
I think it has to be the internet. It has already changed so much in our daily lives, **to the point where** it's hard to imagine life without it now. The **transmission** of information is **virtually instant** now, which has revolutionized the way we communicate and the way we work. We're also able to access any information we wish **with the touch of a button**, which is great for teachers and people's education. **Best of all**, most of this can be done through one device, so the internet is probably the most important thing to happen in the last century.
