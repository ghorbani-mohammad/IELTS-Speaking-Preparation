#### 1. What's the best invention in the past one hundred years?
I think it has to be the internet. It has already changed so much in our daily lives, **to the point where** it's hard to imagine life without it now. The **transmission** of information is **virtually instant** now, which has revolutionized the way we communicate and the way we work. We're also able to access any information we wish **with the touch of a button**, which is great for teachers and people's education. **Best of all**, most of this can be done through one device, so the internet is probably the most important thing to happen in the last century.

#### 2. What's the influence of science on human life?
I think science influences almost **every part of our daily lives** at the moment. Science is involved in the medicine that we take when we are sick, including the health **supplements** we take to keep us healthy. As well as that, the electronic devices we use every day have been developed with the knowledge that **scientific research** has provided. Finally science has helped us find more echo-friendly and **renewable** fuel sources, which should influence **the future of humanity** as it **lessens the strain** on natural resources.

#### 3. What can individuals do for scientific research?
**Off the top of my head**, the only fet things I can think of are **donating** money to scientific research groups, or actually **going ahead** and participating in **scientific studies** yourself. There are plenty of people who actually **make a living** as **human guinea pigs**, where they allow scientists to test new drugs on them and **observe** their reactions. So I suppose those are a few ways you can **contribute** to science even if you don't have any scientific **qualifications**.
