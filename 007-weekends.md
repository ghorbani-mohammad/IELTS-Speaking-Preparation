#### 1. What do you usually do on weekends?
"I think it depends on my friends, because if they ask me to **hang out** then I'll go out and have a coffee or something to eat with them. **Otherwise**, I usually just try to **top up on** groceries for the week at the supermarket. If there's **nothing going on** then I'll just **chill out** at home on my phone or by **channel-hopping** on TV. There's also a park near my house so if i'm really bored, I'll **wander around** the park."

#### 2. Did you do anything special last weekend?
"Yes, actually it was **my friend's 30th** last weekend so we went out for a meal to celebrate. We didn't do anything **too crazy**, but we had some nice food and some drinks to **mark the occasion**."

#### 3. What will you do next weekend?
"I haven't got any plans **as of right now** actually, I've just been focusing on passing my IELTS test. I'll probably ask some of my friends in our group chat if they're **up to anything** this weekend and then see if I want to **take them up on any offers**. If not, I might actually visit my parents since I haven't been to see them in a little while."
