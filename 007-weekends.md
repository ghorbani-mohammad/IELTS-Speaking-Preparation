#### 1. What do you usually do on weekends?
"I think it depends on my friends, because if they ask me to **hang out** then I'll go out and have a coffee or something to eat with them. **Otherwise**, I usually just try to **top up on** groceries for the week at the supermarket. If there's **nothing going on** then I'll just **chill out** at home on my phone or by **channel-hopping** on TV. There's also a park near my house so if i'm really bored, I'll **wander around** the park."
