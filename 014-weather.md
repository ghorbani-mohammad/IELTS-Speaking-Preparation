#### 1. What is the weather like in your hometown?
I would say that the weather is very pleasant there, we get mild winters with occasional rain and hot summers moderated by the ocean breezes. It's a great place to live or visit, especially if you like warm temperatures year-round!

#### 2. Do you have a favorite season?
I absolutely love springtime. I used to love summer when I was younger, because it was longest break we had from school, but I found that as I got older, spring became my favorite season.

#### 3. Why is this season your favorite?
I love spring because the weather is finally starting to get nicer. The flowers start blooming, the sun comes out more often, and it's not as cold outside. It's a great time to go on walks and enjoy nature.
