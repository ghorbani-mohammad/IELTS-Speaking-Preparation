#### 1. Do you like texting?
"Texting is actually my **preferred way** of contacting people these days because I can reach out to my friends and family **anytime, anywhere**. I think it's much more **convenient** than ringing someone because they can just reply when they've got **a spare moment** instead of me **interrupting** them."

#### 2. Do you prefer sending or receiving messages?
"I suppose I prefer getting texts, because they are usually funny **memes** or messages from my friends. **Getting an alert** from one of my friends also feels good because it means they were **thinking of me** or wanted to show me something that will make me laugh."
