#### 1. Do you like texting?
Texting is actually my **preferred way** of contacting people these days because I can reach out to my friends and family **anytime, anywhere**. I think it's much more **convenient** than ringing someone because they can just reply when they've got **a spare moment** instead of me **interrupting** them.

#### 2. Do you prefer sending or receiving messages?
I suppose I prefer getting texts, because they are usually funny **memes** or messages from my friends. **Getting an alert** from one of my friends also feels good because it means they were **thinking of me** or wanted to show me something that will make me laugh.

#### 3. Have you ever received a confusing text message?
Yes definitely. Sometimes my friends send me messages **by mistake**, instead of their parents or colleagues. It's **easily done** because our **thumbs** are faster than our eyes nowadays. Normally we just **laugh it off** because it is **an honest mistake**, and I'm sure I've done the same to some of my friends as well.

#### 4. In what circumstances is making a phone call better than sending a text message?
I think if you've got to **deliver** some bad news or **relay** an important and **detailed** message then you should do it **over the phone** rather than through text. Texts don't **come across** as very **sympathetic**, so they can appear **cold** or rude, so calling someone helps you **break bad news** more **gently** to help the other person **cope** or to check that they've understood everything you've told them.
