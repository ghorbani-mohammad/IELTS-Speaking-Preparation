#### 1. Did you go on picnics when you were a child?
"To be honest, hardly ever. There was a park just a stone's throw from our house, but we only ever played soccer or rode our bikes around it - we never used to bring any food. Instead, we tended to eat at one of the nearby restaurants because it was easier and they served better food than anything we could bring in a picnic basket!"

#### 2. How often do you go on a picnic now?
"Never, to be **totally honest**. I don't think I've been on a picnic **in my adult life**. Maybe I will when I'm a bit older or have children, but I'm mich more interested in eating at restaurants because they serve **a wider selection of meals**, it's nice and warm in the winter and you don't have to do any of the **washing up** afterwards!"
