#### 1. Did you go on picnics when you were a child?
To be honest, **hardly ever**. There was a park just **a stone's throw from** our house, but we only ever played soccer or rode our bikes around it - we **never used to** bring any food. Instead, we **tended to** eat at one of the nearby restaurants because it was easier and they served better food than anything we could bring in a picnic basket!

#### 2. How often do you go on a picnic now?
Never, to be **totally honest**. I don't think I've been on a picnic **in my adult life**. Maybe I will when I'm a bit older or have children, but I'm much more interested in eating at restaurants because they serve **a wider selection of meals**, it's nice and warm in the winter and you don't have to do any of the **washing up** afterwards!

#### 3. Where do you go on a picnic?
If I had to go on a picnic, I suppose I would try and have one **down by the river** in the park near my home. It's quite **a secluded little spot** so we'd have some **peace and quiet**, and I'd probably invite my family or just **head there** with my partner some food and **fresh air**.

#### 4. What is the difference between a picnic and cooking at home?
I suppose the main differences are the types of food that you can prepare or **pack**. For a picnic, for example, you have to bring **portable** food that doesn't require any **cutlery** like fruit, sandwiches or snacks. Also, if you don't want your picnic basket to be **cumbersome** and heavy, then you can only pack **small-ish portions of food**. **Whereas** at home, you are free to cook **whatever your heart desires**, because you don't have to take it anywhere.
