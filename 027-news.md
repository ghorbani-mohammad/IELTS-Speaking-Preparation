#### 1. Where do people get news?
**As with most things** nowadays, the internet is **the main source** of information for most people. Most phones come **pre-installed** with some kind of news app now, plus there is **a whole host** of online news sites where you can get **breaking news** updates. **Not to mention**, there are also 24-hour **rolling news** channels on TV which **broadcast topical news** from **around the globe**.

#### 2. What kind of news do people like to read? Why?
I think it depends on the person, because some people are quite interested in **current events** and political **goings-on**. **Businesspeople** especially might want to **keep abreast** of the latest business trends, whereas others are only concerned with **local news** because they feel that affects them most. Others, however, probably find **current news** so **depressing** that they only **read feelgood** stories with **happy endings**.

#### 3. How can companies tell the public its news? On the internet or through press conferences?
Due to COVID-19 a lot of companies **shifted** their product **launches** and press conferences online, and now most businesses **live stream** big events for free. That way, fans are more **engaged** in the **reveal** of the product and they don't have to wait to read about it online a few hours afterwards. In the **pandemic**, it's also a safe way **to go about things**.

#### 4. What do you think of the news on social media?
I think if people follow **verified** news agencies, then they should be able to trust what they read on social media sites. However, unfortunately there is **a worrying amount** of news that is **unreliable** or completely **falsified**. It's becoming increasingly difficult to tell the difference between official and unofficial **news sources**, so I'd say that most people should get their news from **bonafide** newspaper or news websites.
