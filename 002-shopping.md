#### 1. Do you make a list when you shop?
Yes, definitely. I have to **or else** I'll forget everything that I went to the supermarket for. My partner and I use an **online note-keeping app** on our phones so we can update each other's lists with new items while one of us is shopping, that way we don't forget anything.

#### 2. Do you make a list for your work? (Does it help?)
It works for me, yes. **I have a lot on my plate** at work so I need to keep track of all my daily tasks so I don't miss any **important deadlines** or meetings. If I didn't keep myself organized at work I would quickly **lose track of** things and **get in trouble**.

#### 3. Why don't some people like making lists?
I suppose some people think that **their memories** are so good they don't need to make them because they can remember everything they need. I also know some people who would prefer to actually start **getting on with** their work instead of **wasting time writing out a list** of everything they should already be doing.
