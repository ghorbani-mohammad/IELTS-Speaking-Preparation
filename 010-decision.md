#### 1. What decision do people make every day?
"I think people make **dozens** of little decision every day. **First and foremost**, they have to decide what to eat for all 3 **main meals** of the day. As well as that, they need to choose their outfits - either for work or for informal occasions. Their **biggest decisions** probably come at work while they're completing their **daily tasks** and trying to help their colleagues or customers."

#### 2. Why do people make decisions?
"I suppose people make decisions when they are responsible for the **outcome** of that decision. In other words, people have to choose something healthy if they want to **stay in shape**, or they should **pick out** some smart, professional outfits if they need to appear **competent** and capable at work. **Last but not least**, they are paid to make important decisions at work to help their company succeed, so those are some main reasons why people make decisions."

#### 3. Can children make decisions on their own?
"I think it depends on their level of **maturity** and the decision they're required to make. At a restaurant for example, the **stakes are pretty low**, so it's okay for young kids to decide what they want to eat. However, at school, kids probably shouldn't be allowed to choose what they study because **they would likely** just want to play games or draw pictures, so in that case it's better to let the teachers decide."
