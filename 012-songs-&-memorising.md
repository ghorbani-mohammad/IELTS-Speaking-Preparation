#### 1. Are you good at memorising things?
"I've got **a memory like a sieve**, unfortunately. Most information **goes in one ear and out the other**. I can just about remember my phone nad PIN number because those are obviously very important, but everything else, like names, birthdays, dates or vocabulary, if I don't write it down and try to **commit it to memory**, I'll forget it."

#### 2. Do you think children would like the rhythm of songs or poems? Why?
"Children definitely do, we can see that from **nursery rhymes**, which always have **catchy**, fun and memorable **melody**. There are plenty of songs from school that I can still remember even today, like The Wheels on the Bush and Head-Shoulders-Knees-And-Toes because they have a **tune** that **sticks in your head**. Also, kids enjoy repeating things they like, so if a song is fun to **sing along** to, then they will do it lots of time and naturally remember it."

#### 3. Do you think it is easier for children to learn a song or poem than adults? Why?
"I think it's easier for kids to remember things because their brains are **simply better** at it. As we get older, I think our **memory function** becomes more **sluggish** and it takes more effort to **commit something to memory**. Whereas when I was at school, I could memorize a whole song after just listening to it a few times, which I definitely can't do anymore."

#### 4. What can people learn from songs or poems?
"Songwriters and poets are very good a finding **metaphors** and **analogies** that match our emotions, which means they can help us understand and describe how we feel much more accurately. I think that helps people learn how to describe their own feelings and emotions. Songs in other languages are also **a great tool** to help learner **pick up** new vocab and grammar structures, so we can learn a lot from songs and poems, I think."
