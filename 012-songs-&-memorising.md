#### 1. Are you good at memorising things?
"I've got **a memory like a sieve**, unfortunately. Most information **goes in one ear and out the other**. I can just about remember my phone nad PIN number because those are obviously very important, but everything else, like names, birthdays, dates or vocabulary, if I don't write it down and try to **commit it to memory**, I'll forget it."

#### 2. Do you think children would like the rhythm of songs or poems? Why?
"Children definitely do, we can see that from **nursery rhymes**, which always have **catchy**, fun and memorable **melody**. There are plenty of songs from school that I can still remember even today, like The Wheels on the Bush and Head-Shoulders-Knees-And-Toes because they have a **tune** that **sticks in your head**. Also, kids enjoy repeating things they like, so if a song is fun to **sing along** to, then they will do it lots of time and naturally remember it."
