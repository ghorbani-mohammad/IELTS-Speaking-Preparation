#### What you taught them to do
Ok, I'm going to describe an event when I taught my parents how to use messaging applications like Telegram and WhatsApp. As I mentioned, in this memory, I explained to my father how they can send messages to whoever they want effortlessly. With advancing technology, there have been introduced different ways for communicating with others. In my mind, the easiest way is using communication applications like Telegram.

#### Who you taught
My parents have aged, and they used to make calls to communicate with other people, including us. So I always felt that I needed to teach them using messaging applications. After a while, finally, I did it.

#### How you taught them
Well, I had to show them the process step by step and at a slow pace as they were older. Even I remember I had made some tutorial videos for them so they could easily watch the videos if they had forgotten the instructions. By leveraging those videos, they could see how they can find the application, how they should open the lock and then how they can find the desired person, and finally, how they are able to send a message.


### PART 3

#### 1. How can we know what to do when we want to learn something new?
Well, I think the first thing that we need to do is acquire some information about the problem or subject. Nowadays, I believe we are able to get information effortlessly by using technologies like the Internet. So I would suggest grabbing your phone and googling about your problem. I'm assured that you will find practical information about the topic and how you can conquer the subject.

#### 2. Do people in your country like to watch videos to learn something?
Yes, I think so. Actually, I'm of the opinion that watching videos would be easier to master something and can be a good source for the beginning of your journey. You know, sometimes reading books and articles can be boring and tedious. As a result of that, I reckon watching movies is the preferred way for most people to learn something.

#### 3. Do you think showing is a better way than telling in education?
Yes, I definitely think that leveraging images and videos is more impactful on learning something. It would be better not to rely just on audio connection with learners; instead, involve some visual effects in the education to get the best possible results. Including visual effects can engage the audience more deeply.

#### 4. What practical skills can young people teach old people?
Well, I think youngsters can teach plenty of practical skills to older people. For instance, they can guide elderly people who can use their smartphones and laptops to pay their home bills. They can instruct them how can send messages or photos using social platforms like Telegram and Whatsapp. Moreover, they can teach them the way modern equipment and tools in the kitchen work.

#### 5. How can we teach an older generation to use new technology?
Well, I believe we need to take a different approach when it comes to teaching elderly people, as they need a more slow-paced tutorial. We should keep our tutorials effortless and demonstrate them in a step-by-step manner. Moreover, we should engage their personal interests, so they would be passionate about the technology, and the process of learning would be endurable for them. Additionally, showing them how these technologies can positively impact their life can have a good impact on the process.

#### 6. What's the difference between children learning and adults learning what they have to learn?
Well, that is a hard question for me as I have never thought about that. I guess children are more dependent on their teachers in comparison to elderly people who mostly rely on their own life experiences. Moreover, kids are usually motivated by external pressure and the consequences of failure. On the contrary, elderly people learn new things because of a desire for self-improvement, recognition, and self-confidence.

#### 7. Where can we learn practical skills?
Well, Nowadays, there are various ways to learn new practical skills. I reckon the easiest way would be online courses which we can find on the Internet. Additionally, there are profitable institutes all over the city where we can find helpful classes there. Moreover, sometimes we can leverage our friendship and learn new professions from our friends.
