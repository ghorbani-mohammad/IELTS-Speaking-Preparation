### PART 2

**Describe a time when someone gave you something you really wanted**
- **What it was**
- **How you got it**
- **Why you wanted it so much**

#### - what it was
Okay, So yeah I remember five years ago I had started my master's degree at University and back then I had an old smartphone that I had been using for almost six years. You know, I had got into one of the best universities in our country and it was a little embarrassing to use that phone in front of other students and my friends.

#### - how you got it
I'm lucky because I have a such supportive brother who is working for a big company named Digikala and I remember back then he had noticed my uncomfortable situation. One day I was studying in my room and suddenly my brother came in with a gift in his hands. He asked me to open it up and when I did that I saw a brand-new smartphone from Apple. So it was the best-needed gift that I ever had.

#### - why you wanted it so much
As I said, I had received admission from a top three university in our country and I recall most of the other students had pricey phones and laptops. It was kinda embarrassing for me to work with my old phone and I always had to be conscious about my situation to avoid my friends noticing my old phone. Besides that, my phone was getting slower and slower and its battery wasn't healthy anymore and I had to charge it frequently.

### PART 3

#### 1. **What rewards do children want to get?**
Well, I reckon there are plenty of things that can make kids happy as they have simple dreams and interests. For instance, you can make them happy just by buying new toys or new stationery tools. Additionally, they usually are fond of going out or going on a picnic in parks or near mountains. Moreover, sometimes they would be over the moon if parents allow them to stay at friends' homes and be with their friends all day.


#### 2. **What are children usually rewarded for at school?**
Hmm, I think there are some events at schools where students are rewarded. Sometimes students are rewarded for getting good grades. Besides that, some students are applauded because of their moral behaviors. Moreover, I reckon there are some festivals in schools where students with the best performance and show will are appreciated too.


#### 3. **What rewards can children get from school?**
Well, children can get various rewards. Often, they get certificates for their stellar performance at their schools. Sometimes they are offered a trip to cities with good nature and weather. Occasionally, they are given some pieces of equipment related to studying or other stuff like sports. Moreover, the teachers and school authorities can make a simple call to their parents to inform them about the achievements of their children and appreciate their effort.


#### 4. **What rewards can companies offer to outstanding employees?**
Well, I guess the most famous reward for a hard-working employee would be a job promotion. However, it's not required to be a complex reward, they can simply throw a party maybe with lunch to make their employees happy. Additionally, they can give them some gift cards. Moreover, they can provide them with some honor certificates which I think can be long-lasting memories for employees.
