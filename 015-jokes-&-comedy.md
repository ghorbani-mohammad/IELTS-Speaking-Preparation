#### 1. Do people like comedy?
Yes absolutely. Comedy is one of the most popular **film genres** in the world. Comedy movies **attract big audiences** and **generate** a lot of money at **the box office** too. I suppose it's because laughing helps people **blow off steam** and forget about their stress. People especially like watching comedy with their friends because laughing together is definitely **a bonding exercise** as well.
