#### 1. Do you recycle now? Why?
"Yes I do. I've been recycling **for as long as I can remember**. I think it's extremely important that everyone tries to reduce their **impact on the planet**, and recycling is a very **straightforward** and **impactful** way to **cut down on** the amount of waste we produce. So I always crush **cans**, **rinse** plastic bottles, and **separate** my rubbish before **disposing** of it in the right **receptacle**."

#### 2. Did you recycle when you were a kid?
"Only a little bit. When I was at school recycling was a **fairly new idea**, and it wasn't until the government made it **mandatory** and supplied every **household** with **recycling bins** that my family started **taking it seriously** and recycling everything and I guess I must have started around then as well."
