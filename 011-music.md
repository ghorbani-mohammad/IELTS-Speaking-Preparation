#### 1. Why do many young people spend a lot of money on music concerts?
"It seems like young people are willing to fork over a lot of money for concert tickets just to get a glimpse of their favorite stars in the flesh. Usually they only see them through social media or on screens, so they'll get a chance to interact with or talk to the singer or the band as well."

#### 2. Do you think older people like the same music as young people?
"I think that people's **taste in music** doesn't change all that much from when they were young, which means that whatever music **they were into** when they were kids is the same music that **they're into** now. Many people still listen to their favorite artists from their **teens**, so what old people listen to depends on what was popular when they were young. Meanwhile, young people are interested in brand new artists because they think anything old is **uncool** or **out-of-touch**."
