#### 1. Why do many young people spend a lot of money on music concerts?
"It seems like young people are willing to fork over a lot of money for concert tickets just to get a glimpse of their favorite stars in the flesh. Usually they only see them through social media or on screens, so they'll get a chance to interact with or talk to the singer or the band as well."

#### 2. Do you think older people like the same music as young people?
"I think that people's **taste in music** doesn't change all that much from when they were young, which means that whatever music **they were into** when they were kids is the same music that **they're into** now. Many people still listen to their favorite artists from their **teens**, so what old people listen to depends on what was popular when they were young. Meanwhile, young people are interested in brand new artists because they think anything old is **uncool** or **out-of-touch**."

#### 3. Do you think music concerts are suitable for old people to attend?
"Definitely. Most concert halls have **seating options**, either at the back or **in the wings**. So if an elderly person decides to attend a concert, they can sit down if they need to **take a rest**. There are also some artists who have **predominantly** older fans, so they definitely try to make their concerts suitable for people **of all ages**."

#### 4. Why do shopping malls often have background music?
"I think they're trying to create a relaxing and comforting **ambience** for their customers. If there wasn't any music being played in a mall, then it would sound uncomfortably quiet. You could hear everyone's conversations, every footstep, and the food court would be very loud. So I guess that's why they play 'muzak' or background music."
