#### 1. What are the types of books that young people like to read?
Fiction and fantasy seem to be **bestsellers** among **young readers** - books like Harry Potter and The Hobbit. I think they are **hits** with kids because tend to have quite **active imaginations**, so they can **envisage** these **fantastical** worlds and creatures **in their heads** while they read. **In contrast**, kids tend to dislike history because the writing can very **dry** and boring for them.

#### 2. What's the difference between the reading habits of old people and young people?
I suppose elderly people read for **pleasure** more often that children simply because they have more free time so they're able to **delve into** much longer books. Younger readers probably prefer shorter books **set** in fantasy or fictional **universes**, because that's more likely to appeal to them and interest them enough to read.
