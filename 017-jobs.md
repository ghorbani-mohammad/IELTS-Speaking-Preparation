#### 1. What kinds of jobs need a lot of physical work?
One of the most physical jobs I can think of is construction work. A lot of those guys work in **the baking sun**, **lugging around** heavy materials like bricks, sand and concrete, all in **protective gear** which must be very hot too. Being mechanic must also be quite physical because wheels and engines are extremely **weighty**. Decorating a room is **surprisingly hard work** as well, even painting a wall or moving some furniture can be **exhausting**.

#### 2. What's the difference between the payment for physical work and that for mental work?
Nowadays, jobs that require a high level of **mental intelligence** seem to earn much higher salaries than **physical labourers**. I suppose that's because it's difficult for most people to remember such **vast quantities** of information like how doctors have to remember medicines, **side-effects** and other physical **ailments** for their patients. Likewise, scientists have to remember a huge number of **mathematical equations**, **formulae** and other information to do their work. That's considered much more difficult than physical work, which can be **mastered** with a lot of practice and time - and I think that's reflected in their salaries.

#### 3. Can physical workers receive higher salaries in the future?
I'm not sure. If they can **specialize** in a very **niche** area, then they might be able to charge their clients more for their work, but in the future I think most **manual work** will be **phased out** by machines or robots. So maybe their only chance to make more money is to make something quite unique.

#### 4. Do you think machines could replace human workers in the future?
Yes I do. It's already happening across many professionals, like in supermarkets, fast food restaurants and so on. Robots are becoming **capable** of more and more tasks each year, so I think it'll be **a matter of time** until many jobs are completely **automated**. However, some jobs which require **a human touch** should still be done by humans, like teachers and doctors, because robots are quite poor at **reading human emotions**.
