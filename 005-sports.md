#### 1. What sports did you do when you were a kid?
"When I was a kid I was **really into** athletics. My **preferred events** were the 400 and 800 meters, but also **had a go** at long jump as well. I think I was pretty good at it, because I **represented** my school a few times in some **local contests**, but I stopped **competing** in high school because I put **all my energy** towards my studies. **Other than that**, I enjoyed football and basketball because I could play them with my friends."

#### 2. What's your favorite sport? Why?
"My favorite sport has always been Formula one. I've been watching it ever since I was a kid, and I still **tune in** to watch the races **live**, even if they start at **the crack of dawn** like in Australia or Japan. I love anything with wheels and an engine but I think the design of the F1 cars, the speed and the technology has always **fascinated** me."
