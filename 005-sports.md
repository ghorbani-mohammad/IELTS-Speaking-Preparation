#### 1. What sports did you do when you were a kid?
"When I was a kid I was **really into** athletics. My **preferred events** were the 400 and 800 meters, but also **had a go** at long jump as well. I think I was pretty good at it, because I **represented** my school a few times in some **local contests**, but I stopped **competing** in high school because I put **all my energy** towards my studies. **Other than that**, I enjoyed football and basketball because I could play them with my friends."

#### 2. What's your favorite sport? Why?
"My favorite sport has always been Formula 1. I've been watching it ever since I was a kid, and I still **tune in** to watch the races **live**, even if they start at **the crack of dawn** like in Australia or Japan. I love anything with wheels and an engine but I think the design of the F1 cars, the speed and the technology has always **fascinated** me."

#### 3. Do you watch sport matches? Why?
"Yes definitely. I've **attended** several F1 races at different **venues** in different countries, and I have visited my local **stadium** to watch Colchester United **in the flesh** as well. The **atmosphere** at live events is always **electric**. I wish I could go and watch more sports events live, and I hope I can after COVID-19 disappears **for good**."

#### 4. Are you a fan of any sport teams? Why?
"I'm **a fan of** my local soccer team, which is Colchester United, as well as Liverpool F.C in the English Premier League because they have an incredible **line-up** of players at the moment. In Formula 1, I support the Mercedes F1 team because they are the class of the field, and they have an outstanding driver and world champion called Lewis Hamilton behind the wheel of their cars."
