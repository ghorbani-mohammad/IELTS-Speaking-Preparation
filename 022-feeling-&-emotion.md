#### 1. Is it difficult for some people to express their feelings?
I think it **varies from person to person**. There are some people who **wear their hearts on their sleeves**, **most likely** because they were raised in a more emotional and open **household**. At the same time, there are people who are very **reserved** about their feelings. **Typically** it's men who **struggle** with expressing their emotions, it may be because they have been taught that men shouldn't express themselves openly as it's **a sign of weakness** or an **overreaction**. I think women tend to **open up** a little more freely than men because there's less **stigma** attracted to it.
