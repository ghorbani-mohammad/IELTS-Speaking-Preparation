#### 1. Who is usually the leader in a family?
Traditionally, it's been **the father of the house** who's seen **as the head of the family**. I suppose that's because men typically earn a higher **income** than women do, so they believe that **gives them the right** to make most of the decisions for the family. That said there are also families where the mother is the leader, because she probably spends more time with the children and so knows what's best for them **going forward**. So I think it depends on the family.

#### 2. How do grandparents take care of grandchildren?
Since most grandparents are retired, they have a lot of free time **on their hands**, so they can spend time with younger children, either by **babysitting** at home or taking them outside. I think it's good for both of them because **we have a saying**: "Kids keep you young" which means that spending time with kids makes older people happy and helps them find their own **inner child**. So **it's not uncommon** to see grandparents at the park with their grandkids, or spending time with them at home while the parents work.

#### 3. What's the most important quality of parents?
I think all good parents are kind, supportive and patient with their children. They have to be patient in their child's **early years** while they learn to **behave properly**, and likewise they have to be patient while they **figure out** what they want to do in their **adult life** too. Most importantly, though, they should support their children in **whatever path they choose** and help them **make the most of** their opportunities and decisions, whether that's in their hobbies, education or careers.
