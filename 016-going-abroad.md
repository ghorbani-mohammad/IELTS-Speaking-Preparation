#### 1. What kind of work can young people do in foreign countries?
Most young people seem to work in **hospitality**, like in hotels, bars or restaurants. Those kinds of places have fairly **menial work** and long shifts where you're **on your feet** all day, so it takes a young person with lots of energy to do it. If they're qualified, the young people can also go abroad to teach **their mother tongue**. That kind of work also requires a lot of energy and **fearlessness**, so it's perfect for younger people.

#### 2. Is it good for young people to have experience of living in other countries?
Yes, absolutely. Traveling or living abroad can help young people mature and **gain a better understanding** of the world. **Stepping outside of their comfort zone** could also give them more **self-belief**, because they will have to **take on** new challenges, such as the **language barrier** and cultural differences. So I think it's a very **beneficial** experience for them.
