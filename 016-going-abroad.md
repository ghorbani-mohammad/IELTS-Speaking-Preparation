#### 1. What kind of work can young people do in foreign countries?
Most young people seem to work in **hospitality**, like in hotels, bars or restaurants. Those kinds of places have fairly **menial work** and long shifts where you're **on your feet** all day, so it takes a young person with lots of energy to do it. If they're qualified, the young people can also go abroad to teach **their mother tongue**. That kind of work also requires a lot of energy and **fearlessness**, so it's perfect for younger people.

#### 2. Is it good for young people to have experience of living in other countries?
Yes, absolutely. Traveling or living abroad can help young people mature and **gain a better understanding** of the world. **Stepping outside of their comfort zone** could also give them more **self-belief**, because they will have to **take on** new challenges, such as the **language barrier** and cultural differences. So I think it's a very **beneficial** experience for them.

#### 3. Why are some people unwilling to work in other countries?
I suppose most people are **put off** by **homesickness**, as in, they would miss their family and friends, their favorite meal might be difficult to find and it could make life hard **overseas**. **The language barrier** is another **obstacle** in people's daily lives when they're outside of their **home country**, so overall it can be quite a stressful and **mentally taxing** experience.

#### 4. What's the difference between working in an international company and working in a domestic one?
"I think in an international company you're much more likely to **come into contact** with people from other countries, because they might be your colleagues or even your clients. That means you also get practice your English or language skills, and you might even be offered a job in an **overseas branch** for a short while. So I think there are lots more exciting opportunities in an international company than domestic one. Because in a domestic business, the **chances** of you meeting **foreigners** seem much **slimmer**."
