#### 1. What kinds of things do people forget easily?
"It's usually small, **everyday essentials**, like keys, phones, wallets and so on. Even though they are very important, we tend to **assume** that we always **have them on us**, so we can leave the house thinking that it's in your pocket or your bag, when it's actually sitting on **the counter** in the kitchen. Names, dates and birthdays usually **slip people's minds** as well because we already know so many that it's hard to remember any new ones."

#### 2. What kinds of people are more forgetful?
"I think people who are a bit **disorganized** or **scatterbrained** might be more **prone** to forgetting things. If someone puts down their phone or their keys in a different place every single time they come home, they'll probably have to spend a lot of time **hunting** for their **belongings**. Stressed and tired people's memories also tend to **suffer**, because if they're overwhelmed or **burnt out** at work, then their memory starts to **fade**. Of course, there are also those who just simply have **terrible memories**, where everything just **goes in one ear and out the other**!"

#### 3. How can people improve their memory?
"Nowadays it seems like there are plenty of '**brain-training** games' available online. I think they're supposed to test your **powers** of **recollection** and improve them with fun **matching** puzzles. There are also things called **'Mnemonic' devices**, where you **associate information** with images, or **build a sequence** of events in your head, so you can remember longer pieces of information. So those are some ways that I think could help."
